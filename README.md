# Network Routing Design – FinTec Inc

This project presents a secure, scalable, and resilient network infrastructure designed for FinTec Inc as part of the **MOD003262: Network Routing** module.

## 📄 Overview

The report details the planning and justification of a four-branch network setup, addressing issues of efficiency, security, and high availability. The design includes:

- ✅ OSPF dynamic routing between sites  
- ✅ VLSM-based IP addressing to optimize subnet usage  
- ✅ VLAN segmentation for Finance, Executive, and Employees  
- ✅ Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict internet access outside London  
- ✅ DHCP to automate IP address assignment  
- ✅ Enhanced router & switch security (password encryption, console protection)

## 🧠 Key Focus Areas

- **Routing:** OSPF implementation, VLSM strategy, addressing resilience  
- **Switching:** VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, trunk/access port configs  
- **Access Control:** ACLs for security & compliance  
- **Security:** Password encryption, disabling Telnet, securing ports  
- **DHCP:** Automated dynamic IP addressing  
- **Report:** Structured for board-level stakeholders with detailed diagrams and justifications
